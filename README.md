## Datasets

<a name="diabetic-retinopathy-classification"></a>
### Diabetic Retinopathy Classification
#### [Kaggle EyePACS](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/) 
* **Summary:** Large set of high-resolution retina images taken under a variety of imaging conditions. A left and right field is provided for every subject. Images are labeled with a subject id as well as either left or right
* **Labels:** A clinician has rated the presence of diabetic retinopathy in each image on a scale of 0 to 4
* **Scale:** 	88,702 retinal fundus images (35,126 labelled for training and 53,576 unlabelled for Kaggle challenge evaluation)
<br/><br/>




<a name="glaucoma-classification"></a>
### Glaucoma Classification 
#### [REFUGE Challenge (Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge)](https://refuge.grand-challenge.org/REFUGE2Details/) 
* **Summary:** REFUGE Challenge consists of THREE Tasks: 1) Classification of clinical Glaucoma, 2) Segmentation of Optic Disc and Cup, 3) Localization of Fovea (macular center)
* **Labels:** A clinician has labelled the presence of glaucoma, the location of the fovea, and the segmentation mask for the optic disk and cup
* **Scale:** 	1200 labelled retinal fundus images







<a name="retinal-vessel-segmentation"></a>
### Retinal Vessel Segmentation
#### [DRIVE (Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction)](https://drive.grand-challenge.org/) 
* **Summary:** The DRIVE database has been established to enable comparative studies on segmentation of blood vessels in retinal images
* **Labels:** For the training images, a single manual segmentation of the vasculature is available
* **Scale:** 	40 retinal fundus images (20 labelled for training and 20 unlabelled for Grand Challenge evaluation)
<br/><br/>

#### [STARE (Structured Analysis of the Retina)](https://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/stare/) 
* **Summary:** The STARE dataset is a dataset for retinal vessel segmentation
* **Labels:** For each image, two hand labelled vessel networks are provided
* **Scale:** 	20 labelled retinal fundus images
<br/><br/>


#### [CHASE_DB1](https://blogs.kingston.ac.uk/retinal/chasedb1/) 
* **Summary:** The CHASE_DB1 dataset is a dataset for retinal vessel segmentation
* **Labels:** For each image, two hand labelled vessel networks are provided
* **Scale:** 	28 labelled retinal fundus images
<br/><br/>


#### [HRF](https://www5.cs.fau.de/research/data/fundus-images/) 
* **Summary:** The HRF dataset is a dataset for retinal vessel segmentation which comprises 45 images and is organized as 15 subsets. Each subset contains one healthy fundus image, one image of patient with diabetic retinopathy and one glaucoma image. The image sizes are 3,304 x 2,336, with a training/testing image split of 22/23
* **Labels:** For each image, a labelled vessel network is provided
* **Scale:** 45 labelled retinal fundus images (15 healthy, 15 diabetic retinopathy, 15 glaucoma)
<br/><br/>


#### [RITE (Retinal Images vessel Tree Extraction)](https://medicine.uiowa.edu/eye/rite-dataset) 
* **Summary:** The RITE (Retinal Images vessel Tree Extraction) is a database that enables comparative studies on segmentation or classification of arteries and veins on retinal fundus images, which is established based on the public available DRIVE database (Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction)
* **Labels:** For the training images, a single manual segmentation of the vasculature is available
* **Scale:** 40 retinal fundus images (20 labelled for training and 20 unlabelled for evaluation)
