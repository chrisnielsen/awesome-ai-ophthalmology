### Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
1. [Kaggle EyePACS](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/) 
    * **Summary:** Large set of high-resolution retina images taken under a variety of imaging conditions. A left and right field is provided for every subject. Images are labeled with a subject id as well as either left or right
    * **Labels:** A clinician has rated the presence of diabetic retinopathy in each image on a scale of 0 to 4
    * **Scale:** 	88,702 retinal fundus images (35,126 labelled for training and 53,576 unlabelled for Kaggle challenge evaluation)

### Retinal Vessel Segmentation
#### [Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction](https://drive.grand-challenge.org/) 
* **Summary:** The DRIVE database has been established to enable comparative studies on segmentation of blood vessels in retinal images
* **Labels:** For the training images, a single manual segmentation of the vasculature is available
* **Scale:** 	40 retinal fundus images (20 labelled for training and 20 unlabelled for Grand Challenge evaluation)
